Installation

The default is to run more-or-less in place. You will need to install
nodejs and a few other packages in order to run the simple webserver.
On Ubuntu systems this may look something like:

    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs nodejs-dev
    npm install md5
    cd nodejs/
    ./runsubopt.sh

Pairing Probability Tools

The current version of the arcplot tool uses cgi-bin calls to compute
the pairing probabilities data for the RNA designs. At some future point
it is hoped that this can be added as an API call within the Eterna game.

The cpp.c (Combined Pairing Probabilites) tool was originally compiled
against the ViennaRNA-2.4.9 library but should also compile with the
more recent ViennaRNA-2.4.10. It handles motifs for aptamers/reporters
that are internal loops or hairpins (e.g. theophylline and MS2), but
will not handle multiloops (e.g. tetracycline).

The spp.cpp and dpfe.cpp tools are modeling code that is less accurate for
the second state pairing probabilities, but are necessary at this point
to handle aptamers/reporteres with multiloops (e.g. tetracycline). It was
developed/compiled against a much older version of the ViennaRNA-2.1.19
libraries.

When compiled, these tools should be copied into the bin/ directory
where the arcplot web-server can access them. Precompiled binary versions
have been supplied.
