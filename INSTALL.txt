Installation

This repo contains a version of the arcplot 2-state RNA evaluation
web tool/service for use with a Linux server (Ubuntu/Debian,
Redhat/Centos). It has been tested as a binary install with a Google
Cloud Ubuntu 16.04 LTS instance. (To use other versions, you may need
to recompile the cgi-bin binaries.)

The repo contains compiled versions of the cgi-bin binaries to compute
the pairing probabilities as well as their source files, but does not
include compilation directions for all tools. It also contains the .js
and .html files for the production (arcplot) and development (arcplot2)
versions of the javascript based arcplot tool web-page. Documentation
for using the tool is found elsewhere at a link included at the top of
the arcplot web page.

The default is to run more-or-less in place. You will need to install
nodejs and a few other packages in order to run the simple webserver.

On Ubuntu systems this may look something like:

    sudo apt-get install -y git # not needed on Google Cloud Ubuntu 16.0.5 LTS
    sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
    npm install md5  # do not use sudo

    git clone https://github.com/jandersonlee/arcplot.git
    cd arcplot/nodejs/
    ./runsubopt.sh  # if using default port 8888
    # sudo ./runsubopt.sh 80 # if using port 80 as root


Network Ports and Firewalls

    Be sure that the port you have chosen to use (80/8888) is open in
    your firewall. If using port 80 you may need to run as root using sudo.
    If using port 8888 (the default) you may need to tweak your firewall.

Pairing Probability Tools

The current version of the arcplot tool uses cgi-bin calls to compute
the pairing probabilities data for the RNA designs. At some future point
it is hoped that this can be added as an API call within the Eterna game.

The cpp.c (Combined Pairing Probabilites) tool was originally compiled
against the ViennaRNA-2.4.9 library but should also compile with the
more recent ViennaRNA-2.4.10. It handles motifs for aptamers/reporters
that are internal loops or hairpins (e.g. theophylline and MS2), but
will not handle multiloops (e.g. tetracycline).

Here is how to recompile it with ViennaRNA-2.4.10:

    cd ~/arcplot/tools
    wget https://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/download/sourcecode/2_4_x/ViennaRNA-2.4.10.tar.gz
    tar xzf ViennaRNA-2.4.10.tar.gz
    cp ViennaRNA-2.4.9/examples/cpp.c ViennaRNA-2.4.10/examples/
    cd ViennaRNA-2.4.10
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install
    cd examples
    gcc -o cpp cpp.c -fopenmp -lRNA -lm
    cp cpp ~/arcplot/bin/

The spp.cpp and dpfe.cpp tools are modeling code that is less accurate for
the second state pairing probabilities, but are necessary at this point
to handle aptamers/reporters with multiloops (e.g. tetracycline). It was
developed/compiled against a much older version of the ViennaRNA-2.1.19
libraries.

When compiled, these tools should be copied into the bin/ directory
where the arcplot web-server can access them. Precompiled binary versions
have been supplied.
